This short course introduced statistical experimental design and analysis strategies for quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Participants learned methods for **normalization, missing value imputation, summarization of protein abundances, statistical inference, confidence interval estimation, and differential abundance testing**, as well as multivariate analysis for biomarker discovery.  

The program combined lectures with hands-on case studies using the **MSstats family of packages** (MSstats, MSstatsTMT, MSstatsPTM, and MSstatsShiny), with two tracks offered:  
- **Track 1** (slower, GUI-first) emphasized foundational statistical concepts and MSstats workflows in both R and the Shiny interface.  
- **Track 2** (faster, code-first) focused on advanced R-based workflows, processing of large datasets, and comparisons to alternative statistical methods (e.g., MSqRob, limma, proDA).  

Case studies included **label-free, TMT, and post-translational modification (PTM) experiments**, illustrating how different data processing and modeling choices influence results. Participants left with practical skills to design, analyze, and interpret quantitative proteomics experiments using statistically rigorous methods.
