I taught a short course on quantitative proteomics, covering key concepts from standards, calibration, and statistical considerations in study design to statistical analysis of proteomics experiments. The course also included hands-on training in Panorama for data management and visualization, giving participants both the theoretical background and practical tools to design, analyze, and interpret quantitative proteomics studies with confidence.
