The Bioinformatics course introduced statistical analysis approaches for detecting differentially abundant proteins in targeted proteomics. Specifically experimental design and basic statistical concepts were introduced. After this more advanced statistical methods specifically for targeted proteomics were discussed. Finally, the session ended with a case study walkthrough using the MSstatsShiny platform.
