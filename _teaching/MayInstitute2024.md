This short course introduced statistical experimental design and analysis strategies for quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Participants learned methods for **normalization, missing value imputation, summarization of protein abundances, statistical inference, confidence interval estimation, and differential abundance testing**, as well as multivariate analysis for biomarker discovery.  

The program combined lectures with hands-on case studies using the **MSstats family of packages** (MSstats, MSstatsTMT, MSstatsPTM, and MSstatsShiny).  

Case studies included **label-free, TMT, and post-translational modification (PTM) experiments**, illustrating how different data processing and modeling choices influence results. Participants left with practical skills to design, analyze, and interpret quantitative proteomics experiments using statistically rigorous methods.
