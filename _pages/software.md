Below are tools I develop or co-maintain for quantitative MS-based proteomics
and related analyses.

### MSstats
Statistical analysis framework for quantitative proteomics (label-free, TMT,
SRM/MRM); normalization, summarization, inference, and visualization.  
**Links:** [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstats.html) Â· [Website](http://www.msstats.org/)

### MSstatsTMT
Methods for isobaric labeling (TMT/iTRAQ), including channel normalization and
design-aware modeling for differential abundance.  
**Link:** [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsTMT.html)

### MSstatsPTM
Integrated PTM analysis controlling for global protein changes to estimate
site-level effects and occupancy.  
**Link:** [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsPTM.html)

### MSstatsLiP
Analysis workflow for Limited Proteolysis (LiP) experiments to detect
conformation- or binding-related changes.  
**Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsLiP)

### MSstatsShiny
R Shiny GUI for MSstats, MSstatsTMT, and MSstatsPTM with end-to-end workflows
and interactive plots.
