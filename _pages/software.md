Below are tools I develop or co-maintain for computational biology, including differential analysis of MS-based proteomics and causal inference of different omnics datasets. All tools are open source and are built using R, Python, or C++. 

### MSstats
Statistical analysis framework for quantitative proteomics; normalization, summarization, inference, and visualization.  
**Links:** 
[GitHub](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstats)
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstats.html)
[Website](http://www.msstats.org/)

### MSstatsPTM
Integrated PTM analysis controlling for global protein changes to estimate
site-level effects and occupancy.  
**Link:** 
[GitHub](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsPTM)
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsPTM.html)

### MSstatsLiP
Analysis workflow for Limited Proteolysis (LiP) experiments to detect
conformation- or binding-related changes.  
**Link:**
[GitHub](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsLiP)
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsLiP.html)

### MScausality
Python package for casual inference. Designed for MS-based proteomics, but easily extendable to different types of omnics.
**Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/devonjkohler/MScausality)

### MSstatsTMT
Methods for isobaric labeling (TMT/iTRAQ), including channel normalization and
design-aware modeling for differential abundance.  
**Link:** 
[GitHub](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsTMT)
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsTMT.html)

### MSstatsShiny
R Shiny GUI for MSstats, MSstatsTMT, and MSstatsPTM with end-to-end workflows
and interactive plots.  
**Link:** 
[GitHub](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsShiny)
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsShiny.html)

### MSstatsConvert
Dedicated proteomics converters for different spectral processing tools.
