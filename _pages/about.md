I am a PhD student at [Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/devon-kohler/) in [Olga Vitek's lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.khoury.northeastern.edu/) researching computational methods for mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Specifically, my research interests are focused on the application of statistical and causal inference techniques. 

I am a one of the lead developers for the [MSstats](http://www.msstats.org/) family of R packages. I am the creator of a number packages, including  [MSstatsPTM](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsPTM.html) and [MSstatsLiP](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsLiP.html) packages. Additionally, I have created the R shiny-based GUI [MSstatsShiny](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsShiny/).

I am currently researching applications of causal inference to biochemical systems; leveraging observational MS-based proteomics data and estimating the effect of perturbations on the downstream system. I have recently presented this work at US HUPO and ProbProg.

Background
=============

I grew up on Nantucket, MA and have lived in Massachusetts for the majority of my life. I completed my undergraduate degree at Union College in Schenectady, NY where I studied economics. After college I started my professional career in the Boston area, where I worked as a data analyst for the digital marketing company Cybba Inc. Eventually, I returned to school at Northeastern to refine my modeling and machine learning skills. I completed my Masters in Data Science in December 2020, after maintaining a 4.0 GPA throughout the program, and officially began my PhD in September 2021.
