I am a PhD student at [Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/devon-kohler/) in [Olga Vitek's lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.khoury.northeastern.edu/), researching computational methods for mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Specifically, my research interests are focused on the application of statistical and causal inference techniques. 

I am a one of the lead developers for the [MSstats](http://www.msstats.org/) family of R packages. I am the creator of a number packages, including  [MSstatsPTM](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsPTM.html) and [MSstatsLiP](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsLiP.html) packages. Additionally, I have created the R shiny-based GUI [MSstatsShiny](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsShiny/).

I am currently researching applications of causal inference to biochemical systems; leveraging observational MS-based proteomics data and estimating the effect of perturbations on the downstream system. I have recently presented this work at US HUPO and ProbProg.
