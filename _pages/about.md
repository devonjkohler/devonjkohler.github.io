Hello! I am a PhD candidate at [Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/devon-kohler/) in [Olga Vitek's lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.khoury.northeastern.edu/), where I develop computational methods for analyzing complex biological data. My primary focus is **mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics**, but my work also spans **RNA-seq analysis** and **multi-omics integration** to better understand biological systems.

I specialize in applying and extending statistical and computational techniques for quantitative proteomics, and I am one of the lead developers of the [MSstats](http://www.msstats.org/) family of R packages. I have created multiple extensions, including [MSstatsPTM](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsPTM.html) and [MSstatsLiP](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsLiP.html), as well as the R Shiny-based GUI [MSstatsShiny](https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/MSstatsShiny/) to make these methods more accessible to the community.

Beyond statistical modeling, I work on **causal inference approaches** for predicting the effects of perturbations in biochemical systems, integrating prior biological knowledge with observational data. This research bridges mass spectrometry and transcriptomics, enabling more holistic insights into molecular mechanisms. I have presented this work at **ASMS Asilomar 2023, US HUPO 2023, and HUPO 2024**.

Background
=============

I grew up on Nantucket, Massachusetts, and have spent most of my life in the state. I earned my undergraduate degree in Economics from Union College in Schenectady, NY. After graduation, I began my professional career in the Boston area as a data analyst and engineer at the digital marketing company Cybba Inc., where I built and maintained data pipelines and analytical models.

Driven by my interest in data science and machine learning, I returned to Northeastern University to strengthen my computational and statistical skills. I completed my **Master’s in Data Science** in December 2020 with a 4.0 GPA and officially began my PhD in September 2021.

Outside of research, I’m passionate about the outdoors, including surfing and snowboarding whenever I can. Check out the photos tab!
