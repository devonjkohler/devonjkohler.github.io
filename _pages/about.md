Hi, I'm Devon.

I am a PhD student at Northeastern University researching computational methods for biological systems, in Olga Vitek's lab. My research interests are in causal machine learning and statistical inference. I am an experienced developer with expertise in R, Python, Julia, and SQL. I have created a number of widely used R packages for the analysis of bottom up mass spectrometry based proteomics including [MSstatsPTM](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsPTM.html), [MSstatsLiP](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsLiP.html), and [MSstatsShiny](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsShiny.html). The work on these packages has been presented at US HUPO and ASMS and is in the process of being published.

On the causal modeling side, I am working on applying causal inference algorithms to biochemical systems. Specifically, I have worked on modelling a biological signaling network using probabilist programming, allowing for interventional and counterfactual inference. I have presented this work at ProbProg 2021. Recently I have been working on the application of causal inference to single-cell proteomics experiments. I hope to present this work at the upcoming US HUPO 2023.

Background
=============

I grew up on Nantucket, MA and have lived in Massachusetts for the majority of my life. Coming from Nantucket, I love surfing and the beach; although I also enjoy snowboarding and the mountains as well. I completed my undergraduate degree at Union College in Schenectady, NY where I studied economics. After college I started my professional career in the Boston area, where I worked as a data analyst for the digital marketing company Cybba Inc. Eventually, I returned to school at Northeastern to refine my modeling and machine learning skills. I completed my Masters in Data Science in December 2020, after maintaining a 4.0 GPA throughout the program, and officially began my PhD in September 2021.
