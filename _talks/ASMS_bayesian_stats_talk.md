This talk reviewed bayesian statistical modeling strategies for upstream data processing of MS-based proteomics experiments. This included missing value imputation and summarization of peptide ions to the protein-level. These processing steps were performed with a bayesian model which allowed error propogation at each step. The final summarized values were used for differential analysis in a error-in-variance model.
