Quantitative mass spectrometry proteomic experiments require robust analytic and modeling techniques to ensure the results are correctly interpreted. There are a variety of different tools that can assist researchers in analysis, however they are generally only suited for one type of experimental design and are usually implemented in coding packages. To address these challenges, we have created the UI MSstats-Shiny, an RShiny based UI integrated with the  packages Msstats, MSstatsTMT, and MSstatsPTM providing all users an end-to-end pipeline that can analyze a variety of experimental designs.
