This evening workshop at ASMS 2025 focused on key topics in single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (MS), including labeled vs. label-free approaches, data analysis strategies, balancing throughput and depth, and the future of the field. I was invited to serve as a panel member, contributing expert insights on **data analysis**. The discussion was audience-driven, with prioritized topics addressed in a panel format chaired by the organizers.
